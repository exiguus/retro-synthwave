# Retro Synthwave

The goal of this project is to understand and learn 3d animations with canvas 2d context.

The Example _Retro Synthwave_ code based on the great [work of Victor Ribeiro](https://github.com/victorqribeiro/retroSynthwave).

The [app runs and show](http://retro-synthwave.vercel.app/) the code at the same time.

I wanted to take a deeper look into [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) Build Tool v2 and [CSS](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)[*](https://parceljs.org/languages/css/#css-modules) and [JS modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)[*](https://parceljs.org/blog/rc0/#differential-bundling) with this side project.
